# About

Hi, my name is Christian Vecchiola and I work at IBM Research Australia in the Blockchain team. My team and I did extensive work on Hyperledger Fabric, primarily as users of the framework and lately on integrating new components into the platform. This has led me to get a better understanding of the internals of Hyperledger Fabric and write this guide. Enjoy!
